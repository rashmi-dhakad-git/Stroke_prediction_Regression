# Stroke Prediction Project

**Predicting Stroke with Random Forest**

**Overview:**
This project focuses on predicting strokes in patients using the Random Forest algorithm. The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, hypertension, and more, and the goal is to build a model that can accurately identify individuals at risk of having a stroke.

**Random Forest:**
Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve overall accuracy and reduce overfitting. Each decision tree in the forest is trained on a subset of the data, and the final prediction is determined by aggregating the predictions of individual trees. Random Forest is well-suited for classification tasks, making it an excellent choice for predicting binary outcomes, such as the presence or absence of a stroke in this case.

**Workflow:**

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, features, and target variable.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the data for training.

3. **Correlation Matrix:**
   - Generate a correlation matrix to understand the relationships between different features. This matrix helps identify potential correlations and guide feature selection.

4. **Random Forest Model:**
   - Use the Random Forest algorithm to train a predictive model on the dataset. The model is trained on a subset of the data, and multiple trees are combined to improve accuracy.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is performing and where it may need improvement.

6. **Feature Importance:**
   - Analyze feature importance to understand which features contribute most to the model's predictions. This information is valuable for interpreting the model and making informed decisions about feature selection.

**Key Metrics:**
- **Accuracy:** Measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
- **Precision:** Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
- **Recall (Sensitivity):** Measures the ability of the model to capture all positive instances.
- **ROC Curve:** Visualizes the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

**Conclusion:**
This project demonstrates the application of the Random Forest algorithm for predicting strokes based on patient data. The use of a correlation matrix provides insights into feature relationships, guiding the modeling process. Continuous evaluation and refinement of the model are essential for achieving optimal performance.
